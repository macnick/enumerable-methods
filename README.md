# Enumerable-Methods

### 1st solo project for Microverse's Ruby course

**A simple implementation of my own versions of the following Ruby methods:**

- #each
- #each_with_index
- #select
- #all?
- #any?
- #none?
- #count
- #map
- #inject

Each of my methods is prefixed with my\_. For example instead of #each you use #my_each

## Specifications

All methods accept a block but also work the same as the original methods when a block is not provided.
Specifically #my_map accepts a block or a proc.
#my_inject is implemented to work exactly as the original with checks and it accepts blocks, procs and symbols.
